# Stream Goals

## Done

* I need: Capture events or state or something, so we can report to the PC what buttons are being pressed, etc.
* Serialize these events (I'll just use postcard)
* I need: Some kind of firmware-side thing that listens to "write then read" commands,

## Currently Doing:

* Write a basic embedded-hal driver for the splitpea, drive it host-side

## Next Up:
