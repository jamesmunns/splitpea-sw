# Splitpea firmware

> NOTE: If you're coming here from the "Splitpea Keyboard Development in Rust" video, that code has moved to the [pretty HAL machine](https://github.com/jamesmunns/pretty-hal-machine/) project!

This code is for developing the firmware and driver for the splitpea keyboard.

More docs soon, work in progress!

You can see the development of this project on YouTube:
